# just-freaking-write
Are you the kind of person that spends hours agonizing over a few sentences? Are you sick of ending a writing session with nothing to show for it? Do you wish you could just write an imperfect (but complete) draft? Well today might be your lucky day!

just-freaking-write is a superminimal text editor that prevents backspacing more than a few words. Since it's not meant for you to write a whole document like this, it doesn't save your work to a file. Instead, you just hit ctrl-C to copy the text to your clipboard, which you can then paste into a real text editor for... y'know... editing. Perhaps you can tell by the rambling nature of this paragraph, that it was written using this tool. In fact, I just realized I shouldn't have used a comma in that last sentence, but I CAN"T CHANGE IT NOW. Maybe this will help me finally write my dissertation. Here's hoping!
